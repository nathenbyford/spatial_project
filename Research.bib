	abstract = {BACKGROUND Self-reported counts of intentional abortions in demographic surveys are significantly lower than the actual counts. To estimate the extent of misreporting, previous research has required either a gold standard or a validation sample. However, in most cases, a gold standard or a validation sample is not available.
OBJECTIVE Our main intention here is to show that a researcher has an alternative tool to estimate the extent of underreporting in a given dataset, particularly when neither a valid gold standard nor a validation sample is available.
METHODS We adopt a binomial-thinned zero-inflated Poisson model and apply it to a sample dataset, the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), for which an alternative estimate of the average reporting rate (38\%) is available. We show how this model could be used to estimate the reporting probabilities of intentional abortions by each individual in addition to the overall average reporting rate.
RESULTS Our model estimates the average reporting rate in the NSFG during 2006â€’2013 as 35.3\% (SE 8.2\%). Individual reporting probabilities vary significantly.
CONCLUSIONS Our estimate of the average reporting rate of the dataset used is qualitatively and statistically similar to the available alternative estimate.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis poses a global health risk and Brazil is among the top 20 countries by absolute mortality. However, this epidemiological burden is masked by under-reporting, which impairs planning for effective intervention. We present a comprehensive investigation and application of a Bayesian hierarchical approach to modeling and correcting under-reporting in tuberculosis counts, a general problem arising in observational count data. The framework is applicable to fully under-reported data, relying only on an informative prior distribution for the mean reporting rate to supplement the partial information in the data. Covariates are used to inform both the true count-generating process and the under-reporting mechanism, while also allowing for complex spatio-temporal structures. We present several sensitivity analyses based on simulation experiments to aid the elicitation of the prior distribution for the mean reporting rate and decisions relating to the inclusion of covariates. Both prior and posterior predictive model checking are presented, as well as a critical evaluation of the approach. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.},

	abstract = {Poisson distribution is a classic choice for modelling unbounded count data. However, count data arising in various fields of scientific research often have excess zeros and are under-reported. In such situations, Poisson distribution gives a poor fit and Poisson model based inferences lead to biased estimators and inaccurate confidence intervals. In this paper we develop a flexible model which can accommodate excess zeros and undercount. Internal validation data has been used for making likelihood based inferences. The impact of ignoring undercount and excess zeros are studied through extensive simulations. The finite sample behaviour of the estimators are investigated through bootstrap methodology. Finally, a real life data which is supposedly under-reported and known to have excess zeros is analysed.},
